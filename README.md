# Hi, I'm Adam ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a senior Front-end Web Developer based in Bristol, UK. I enjoy making things with Javascript, HTML and CSS.

From single page sites to mobile web apps, personalised portfolios to big marketing campaigns, prototyping to interactive canvas experiments â€“ I've built many different things. My focus for the past several years has been React/Redux development, but I'm confident I can use any framework and make anything that works in a browser. I focus on mobile responsiveness and performance, good front-end practices, semantics, and modern web standards. I'm comfortable and familiar with working to agile methodologies and within sprints in both small and large organisations.

I'm fortunate to love my job because it offers me the freedom to create experiences and solve problems. I believe that design and function should be centred around the needs of users, being playful, but not overthought; I strive for simplicity in what I make.

My other interests include running, climbing, cycling, woodworking, reading, wine, Paleo food and 80s design. I used to be an Aircraft Technician in the British Army so I have quite a few stories to tell! I'm very outgoing and love big trips and love any type of bog adventure! 

For some examples of my work please have a look at my portfolio, [brewerlogic.com](http://brewerlogic.com), otherwise [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamcbrewer/) has a comprehensive list of all my experience.

Cheers! ðŸ¤˜
